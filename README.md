# NYC-Airbnb-Price-Prediction
In this project, I have used NYC Airbnb data from Kaggle.
I have tried to predict the price of a listing on Airbnb based on various details of the property.
Feature engineering was done using string indexer and one hot encoder.
Algorithms used were simple linear regression and random forest.
I have also found out which features affect the price the most. Feature importance can be collected from random forest model.
